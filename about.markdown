**Currently,** I'm a Content & QA Manager learning web development, with a focus on Python/Django.

**Formerly,** I worked both in-house and freelance as an English writer, editor, and translator. (For a while I thought it was my dream job, but things changed!) Also, it turns out that I enjoy writing a lot more when I don't have to worry so much about making money from it or clients liking it. I'm editing the first draft of my novel as well as researching and writing for a non-fiction project.

**In a hypothetical other life,** where I possessed the right connections, a driving licence, the money & inclination to spend >3 hours on an aeroplane, and the ability to thrive in -30°C temperatures, I would be translating French Canadian literature.

**Otherwise,** you can probably find me devouring as many books as time allows (mainly memoir and literary fiction).
