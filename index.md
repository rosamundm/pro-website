<h2>I'm making the leap from content to code.

  Having gained 360° insight into the content creation and release cycle over my career so far, I pride myself on a cross-departmental attitude and a skillset that’s creative, user-oriented, and analytical. I’m also extremely self-motivated and have been teaching myself web development since mid-2018, heavily focusing on Python/Django. My current goal is to take up my first junior software development role, enriching a team with soft skills acquired through my years as a copywriter and translator.
